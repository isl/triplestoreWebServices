Implementation of Java Maven RESTful web services for importing, searching, updating and exporting digital content 
to/from RDF triplestore database.

The Web services are implemented using the Jersey 2.27 API and RDF4J 2.4.0 library to connect to the triplestore database.
The web server is Apache Tomcat 8.0.53 and Blazegraph 2.1.4 has been used as a triplestore. But, it is possible to use any 
other RDF databases as well, since its URL is specified in the properties file (config.properties). 
In addition, all the necessary web parameters - such as namespace, graph, content types, e.t.c. - can be set in this 
property file.

The operations that are provided to RDF data are:

1)  Insert new RDF data into triplestore (import): The RDF data is in a file that is in RDF format. 
Within the triplestore the data is inserted into a specific namespace and graph that are passed as parameters 
to the web service.
The allowed formats of data are:
    • RDFFormat.BINARY	    [application/x-binary-rdf]
    • RDFFormat.JSONLD		[application/ld+json]
    • RDFFormat.N3		    [text/n3, text/rdf+n3]
    • RDFFormat.NQUADS	    [application/n-quads, text/x-nquads, text/nquads]
    • RDFFormat.NTRIPLES	[application/n-triples, text/plain]
    • RDFFormat.RDFA		[application/xhtml+xml,application/html, text/html]
    • RDFFormat.RDFJSON	    [application/rdf+json]
    • RDFFormat.RDFXML	    [application/rdf+xml, application/xml, text/xml]
    • RDFFormat.TRIG		[application/trig, application/x-trig]
    • RDFFormat.TRIX		[application/trix]
    • RDFFormat.TURTLE	    [text/turtle, application/x-turtle]

    For successful import, the web service returns a success message, otherwise, an error message is returned.

2) Query content to triplestore (query): This web service executes a SPARQL query to retrieve information from the RDF
triplestore database in a particular format. The parameters of the web service are: a string  with the  SPARQL query. 
Another parameter is the format of the returned results (content-type) is: CSV, JSON, SPARQL / XML, and TSV. 
Additional parameters are the namespace from which we want the content to be retrieved and the maximum timeout that allowed 
in order to complete the whole process and return the data. 

    For successful querying, the web service returns the data from the triplestore in the desired format or an error message 
    is returned.


3) Update the existing content in triplestore (update): The parameters for this web service are a SPARQL query for update 
and the namespace we want to update the content. 

    If the content is successfully updated in the triplestore, the web service returns a success message or an error message 
    is returned.


4) Export content from triplestore (export): This web service extracts content of a predefined namespace and graph from 
the RDF database. The data that extracted from the triplestore is stored in a file with a specified name and format. The
file is stored on the disk in the path that Apache Tomcat is installed. The namespace, the graph, the file name and format
are the parameters of the web service. 

    In case of successful extraction of the data from the triplestore, the web service returns the results in the desired 
    format or else an error message is returned.
    
    
To run the project, execute the following command: mvn clean install

Then export the war file and deploy it to Apache Tomcat server.

Finally, the services are accessible at: http: // localhost: 8080 / WebServices / webServices / <web_service>

<web_service> takes values: import, query, update, and export
and then follows the necessary parameters for each web service separately.

Below are examples of the web services:

    • To import new RDF data into the database in the "kb" namespace and "http: //graph.kb.rdf" graph execute:
    http://localhost:8080/WebServices/webServices/import?namespace=kb&graph=http://graph.kb.rdf&contentType=application/rdf+xml
    
    • To retrieve all data from the database in JSON format execute: 
    http://localhost:8080/WebServices/webServices/query?queryString="select * where {?S ?P ?O}"&timeout=100&contentType=application/json

     • To extract RDF data from the database from the "kb" namespace and "http://nt.kb" graph in 
     NT format to a file named "filename" execute:
     http://localhost:8080/WebServices/webServices/export?filename=filename&format=text/plain&namespace=kb&graph=http://nt.kb
